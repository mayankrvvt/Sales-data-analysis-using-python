# Sales-data-analysis-using-python
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data using Python and Pandas. It focuses on identifying trends, analyzing product performance, and deriving insights that support business decision-making.

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze a sales dataset to answer key business questions such as:

• What is the overall sales trend over time?

• Which are the top 10 products by total sales?

• Which products have the highest sales volume?

• Which shipping mode is most preferred by customers?

• Which categories and sub-categories are the most profitable?

Features

• Trend Analysis: Evaluated overall sales performance and growth patterns over time.

• Product Analysis: Identified top-performing products based on sales and quantity sold.

• Shipping Mode Analysis: Determined customer preferences for different shipping methods.

• Profitability Analysis: Highlighted the most profitable categories and sub-categories.

• Visualization: Created clear and informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
